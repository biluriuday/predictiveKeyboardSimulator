predictiveKeyboardSimulator
===========================

sample html keyboard which tries to implement predictive keyboard(like google keyboard, swype, etc.)

This is the most basic version. More UI and code changes need to be done.

The initial version has dictionary with words starting with letter T.

To simulate swipe, press on a letter(starting letter of the word) and hold down the mouse and swipe through the keyboard until you are finished with the word.
Then release the mouse press. Initial version shows, what all letters we have hovered on. Done just for development purpose.
The line beneath shows the suggestions from dictionary.

Planned features(as of now):
Add a new word to dictionary
Able to select word from the list of suggestions(from dictionary)
